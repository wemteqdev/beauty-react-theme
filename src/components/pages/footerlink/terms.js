                        User Reviews
                        <br/><br/>
                        User reviews or ratings for Businesses/Pros do not reflect the opinion of OlaFic. OlaFic receives multiple reviews or ratings for Businesses/Pros by users, which reflect the opinions of the Users. It is pertinent to state that each and every review posted on OlaFic is the personal opinion of the user/reviewer only. OlaFic is a neutral platform, which solely provides a means of communication between users/reviewers including users or businesses/pros owners/representatives with access to business/pro page. The advertisements published on the OlaFic Platform are independent of the reviews received by such advertisers. We are a neutral platform and we don’t arbitrate disputes, however in case if someone writes a review that the business/pro does not consider to be true, the best option for the business/pro representative would be to contact the reviewer or publicly challenge response in order to clear up any misunderstandings. If the Business/Pro believes that any particular user’s review violates any of the OlaFic’ policies, the business/pro may write to us at support@OlaFic.com and bring such violation to our attention. OlaFic may remove the review in its sole discretion if review is in violation of the Terms, or content guidelines and policies or otherwise harmful to the Services
