As a community we know and understand that there are people that will do anything to make businesses, competitors and members look bad. We have zero tolerance for that and have created steps to prevent that. We do not hide any good or bad reviews and never will do. If businesses see that there is no truth to that member's review or they never used their service, they can challenge it. The member has to provide proof of what they said or else that review will be taken out. You can not review your own business as this falls under fraud and your business will be banned and marked for fraud so everyone sees it. We want honest information for the community to share and decide on.

                            Our goal is to create a community where it brings value to both business partners and members. We don't hide or remove reviews good or bad, we want to help business partners to create excellent service/product for the community and build on their weaknesses. Knowing the truth what the business is lacking will help their management and owners to make things better and at the same time bring great experience and value to members. We created a 4 part review system so to assist members and business owners to know and understand things better. Quality, Service, Timeliness, Cost these are the 4 things that matter the most to members and having a breakdown of each will give both businesses and members great value. A business can see that they are performing well in Quality, Service and Cost but their Timeliness is not that great, they can fix this with better scheduling and time management to bring you great experience.
                            <br/>
As you can see Olafic is on your side, for both business partners and members, our goal is to provide both members and partners the tools to make things better and deliver great experience to community and succeed in their business. Members will see businesses will listen to them and build on their weaknesses to create great experience for other members and community.
